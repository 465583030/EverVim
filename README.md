# EverVim
Ultimate Personal Vim Config based on Spf13

## About
I am a faithful vim user and spf13 works fine for me. But it's not easy to install and not portable.  
So I created this repo just to share my config and modification of spf13.  

## Feature
- Portable under windows
- Easy to setup, just one bash away.
- Fancy Molokai theme
- C++ support added
- Remove the php and ruby option by default.


## License
Dual License, under either MIT or Apache
