# EverVim
My Ultimate Personal Vim Config based on [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)

## About
I am a faithful vim user and [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) works fine for me. But it's not easy to install and not portable.  
So I created this repo just to share my config and modification of [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim).  

## Feature
- Support Vim 7.4.x, Vim 8 and of course Neovim
- Portable under windows
- Easy to setup, just one bash away.
- Fancy Molokai theme
- C++ support added
- Remove the php and ruby option by default.
- Use Vim-Plug, its Async!
- Use YouCompleteMe by default, neocomplete as a windows fallback
- Require +lua. (And +python if you use YouCompleteMe)
